    <h1>Challenger Visualization</h1>
    <p>
      This visualization uses data coming from the 23 shuttle flights prior to the challenger disaster of 1986.
      The variables four attributes visualized for each launch are:

      <ul>
        <li>Flight Index: The temporal ordering of the flights.</li>
        <li>Number of O-Rings Distressed</li>
        <li>Launch Temperature (Degrees Fahrenheit)</li>
        <li>Leak Check Pressure (PSI)</li>
      </ul>

      The dataset was compiled to show not only the relationship between launch temperature and O-Ring damage, but also how different the launch temperature was on the day of the Challenger Disaster from the launch temperature during the previous 23 flights.
